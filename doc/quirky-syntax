Is there a reason that .^ and ^ behave differently for scalars? It seems to me that the first one is not interpreted as .^ but rather as 2.0^31. How do we sort such problems?

julia> 2.^31
2147483648.0

julia> 2^31
-2147483648

Note that there are no complaints for all the extra closing parens.

julia> a = ones(5,5))))
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
