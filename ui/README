Here are the instructions for setting up the web repl locally.  I
encourage everyone who wants to work on the web stuff (repl, graphics,
whatever) to do this.

1) Install lighttpd

sudo apt-get install lighttpd

2) Configure lighttpd

The config file is /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf.  Replace it with the
one I attached to this email.  Change the document root to point to
your_path_to_julia/ui/website.

3) Start lighttpd and the julia server:

a) sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd start
b) your_path_to_julia/julia-release-webserver

4) Open your browser and go to localhost
