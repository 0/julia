Here are the instructions for setting up the web repl locally.  I
encourage everyone who wants to work on the web stuff (repl, graphics,
whatever) to do this.

1) Install lighttpd

sudo apt-get install lighttpd

2) Configure lighttpd

The config file is /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf:
- Add "mod_scgi" to server.modules
- Set server.document-root to point to path_to_julia/ui/website
- Add something like this to the bottom (you can use whatever port you want):
    scgi.server = (
      ".scgi" =>
      (( "host" => "127.0.0.1",
         "port" => 1026
      ))
    )

3) Start lighttpd and the julia server:

a) sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd start
b) your_path_to_julia/julia-release-webserver -p port_num

4) Open your browser and go to localhost
