Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for numerical and scientific computing.
It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, and numerical accuracy.
Key features include multiple dispatch, optional typing, and excellent performance through type inference and just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
The language is multi-paradigm, combining features of functional, object-oriented, and imperative styles.
For a more in-depth discussion of the rationale and advantages of Julia over other systems, see the [introduction](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Introduction) in the manual, or [browse all](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/) of the documentation.

## Required Build Tools & External Libraries

- **[GNU make][]** — building dependencies.
- **[gcc, g++, gfortran][gcc]** — compiling and linking C, C++ and Fortran code.
- **[curl][]** — to automatically download external libraries:
    - **[LLVM][]**         — compiler infrastructure.
    - **[fdlibm][]**       — a portable implementation of much of the system-dependent libm math library's functionality.
    - **[MT][]**           — a fast Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator library.
    - **[OpenBLAS][]**     — a fast, open, and maintained [basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) library, based on [Kazushige Goto's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazushige_Goto) famous [GotoBLAS](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2/).
    - **[LAPACK][]**       — library of linear algebra routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.
    - **[ARPACK][]**       — a collection of subroutines designed to solve large, sparse eigenvalue problems.
    - **[FFTW][]**         — library for computing fast Fourier transforms very quickly and efficiently.
    - **[PCRE][]**         — Perl-compatible regular expressions library.
    - **[GNU readline][]** — library allowing shell-like line editing in the terminal, with history and familiar key bindings.

## Supported Platforms

- **GNU/Linux:** x86/64 (64-bit); x86 (32-bit).
- **Darwin/OS X:** x86/64 (64-bit); x86 (32-bit) is untested but should work.

<a name="Download-Compilation"/>
## Download & Compilation

First, acquire the source code either by cloning the git repository (requires **[git](http://git-scm.com/)** to be installed):

    git clone git://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git

or, if you don't have git installed, by using curl and tar to fetch and unpack the source:

    mkdir julia && curl -Lk https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tarball/master | tar -zxf- -C julia --strip-components 1

Next, enter the `julia/` directory and run `make` to build the `julia` executable.
When compiled the first time, it will automatically download and build its [external dependencies](#Required-Build-Tools-External-Libraries).
This takes a while, but only has to be done once.

No installation is required; `julia` is currently run from the directory where it was built.
You might, however, want to make a symbolic link for the executable, for example `ln -s JULIA_PATH/julia ~/bin/julia`.
Please note that the build process will not work if any of the build directory's parent directories have spaces in their names (this is due to a limitation in GNU make).

Congratulations, if you've gotten this far, you are ready to try out Julia.
You can read about [getting started](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Getting-Started) in the manual.

<a name="Emacs-Setup"/>
## Emacs Setup

Add the following line to `~/.emacs`

    (require 'julia-mode "JULIA_PATH/contrib/julia-mode.el")

where `JULIA_PATH` is the location of the top-level julia directory.

<a name="TextMate-Setup"/>
## TextMate Setup

Copy (or symlink) the TextMate Julia bundle into the TextMate application support directory:

    cp -r JULIA_PATH/contrib/Julia.tmbundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/

where `JULIA_PATH` is the location of the top-level julia directory.
Now select from the menu in TextMate `Bundles > Bundle Editor > Reload Bundles`.
Julia should appear as a file type and be automatically detected for files with the `.j` extension.
