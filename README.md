Julia is a very high level dynamic language with optional typing, multiple dispatch, and good performance, achieved by using type inference and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, implemented using LLVM.
The language is multi-paradigm, combining features of functional, object-oriented, and imperative traditions.
For a more in depth discussion of the rationale and advantages of Julia over other systems, see the [Introduction](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/Introduction) in the wiki, or [browse all](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/wiki/) of the wiki documentation.

## Required Build Tools

- gcc
- g++
- gfortran
- GNU make
- curl to download external libraries:
  * fdlibm
  * OpenBLAS
  * LAPACK
  * ARPACK
  * pcre
  * readline
  * mongoose

## Supported Platforms

- x86 and x86/64 GNU/Linux
- x86/64 OS X (x86 OS X should work but is untested)

<a name="Compilation"/>
## Compilation

- Run `make` in `external/` to download and build external dependencies.
- Run `make` in the top-level directory to build julia.

No installation is required â€” julia is currently run from the directory where it was built. You might want to make a symbolic link for the executable, for example `ln -s JULIA_PATH/julia ~/bin/julia`.

<a name="Emacs-Setup"/>
## Emacs Setup

Add the following line to `~/.emacs`

    (require 'julia-mode "JULIA_PATH/contrib/julia-mode.el")

where `JULIA_PATH` is the location of the top-level julia directory.
