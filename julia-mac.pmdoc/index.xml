\f0\fs26 \cf0 \cb2 Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for numerical and scientific computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, and numerical accuracy. It also has easy interfaces to mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for technical computing tasks such as matrix math, random number generation, fast Fourier transforms, and string processing. Key language features include multiple dispatch, optional typing, and excellent performance through type inference and just-in-time (JIT) compilation.}]]></resource></locale></resources><flags/><item type="file">01package.xml</item><mod>description</mod><mod>properties.title</mod><mod>properties.userDomain</mod><mod>properties.anywhereDomain</mod><mod>properties.systemDomain</mod></pkmkdoc>
